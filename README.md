# About
The **Leo Engine** is a game engine built in CoffeeScript arount the HTML Canvas API.

### Purpose
This engine is solely my hobby project for learning. It is _not_ feature complete or tested to make a game with.

### Features
- 2D tile rendering with multiple layers and parallax scroll
- Dynamic frame time rendering
- Sprite animations
- Collision detection
- Level editing (`click` to draw, `alt-click` for pipette, `s` for save and `l` for load
- Compressed serialization of level data
